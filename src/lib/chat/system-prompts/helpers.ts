These functions can be used with React Query's useQuery and useMutation hooks for data fetching and state management.

Important instructions:
- Use the useQuery hook to fetch data from the appropriate API endpoint.
- Include necessary query parameters: model, connectionKey, and any additional parameters as needed.
- Always format monetary values from cents to dollars (with 2 decimal places)

`;

export const uiStylingRules = `
- Never use Grid for layouts. Instead, prefer Flex components or other alternatives for responsive designs. Grid usage breaks the UI. This includes className "grid" or "grid-cols-1", etc".
- Use the Loading component (<Loading />) for any component in a loading state.
- Do not use custom colors for text or background unless specifically requested by the user.
- When using Shadcn components, rely on their built-in props and structure. Only add custom classes if absolutely necessary for functionality or layout, and no other solution exists within the component's design.
- For formatted text, use the Markdown component: <Markdown content={text} />.
- When working with Select component, it now requires that you provide a value for the no select/all option, like <SelectItem value="all">All</SelectItem>.
`;

export const paginationRules = `
- IntegrationOS handles pagination. Always use the cursor value from the latest listUnifiedData response.
- For the first API call, set the cursor value to undefined.
- For subsequent requests, use the most recent cursor value provided by the API.
- Do not create or guess cursor values; only use those returned by the API.
`;

export const formBuildingRules = `
- Use Shadcn UI form components (Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, etc.) for all form elements.
- Place labels above form elements using the Label component.
- Group related form elements with the Card component for organization.
- Maintain consistent vertical spacing between form elements (e.g., 'space-y-4' or 'space-y-6').
- Utilize the Button component for form submission and other actions.
- For complex forms, implement a multi-step approach with progress indicators.
- Follow this structure for form fields:
  \`\`\`jsx
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <Label htmlFor="fieldName">Field Label</Label>
    <Input id="fieldName" placeholder="Enter field value" />
  </div>
  \`\`\`
- Include a default option (e.g., "Select an option") as the first SelectItem for select inputs.
- Use appropriate HTML5 input types (e.g., type="email" for email, type="tel" for phone numbers).
- Create responsive form layouts using Flex components for consistent appearance across screen sizes.
- Never use Grid for layouts. Instead, prefer Flex components or other alternatives for responsive designs. Grid usage breaks the UI. This includes className "grid" or "grid-cols-1", etc".

export const codeStructuringRules = `
- Create a functional component named \`App\`.
- Export the main App component at the end of your code.
- Wrap the main component with: <Card className="w-full h-full">
`;

export const nestedDataAccessRules = `
- Use the optional chaining operator (?.) to safely access nested data and prevent errors when dealing with potentially undefined or null values.
- This approach helps avoid "Cannot read property 'x' of undefined" errors.
- Apply this technique consistently when accessing properties of objects that might be null or undefined.
- Example: \`\`\`
const nestedData = data?.nested?.data;
const lowercaseValue = data?.nested?.toLowerCase();
const arrayLength = data?.nested?.length;
const firstArrayItem = data?.nested?.[0];
const formattedDate = new Date(data?.createdAt)?.toLocaleString();

export const reactQueryUsageRules = `
This is a proper example of how to use ReactQuery. If needed you can use more than one useQuery hook in the same component to load different data models.

\`\`\`typescript
const { data: orders, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: 'orders',
  queryFn: theNeededFunction,
});

const {
  data, error, isError, isIdle, isLoading, isPaused, isSuccess,
  failureCount, failureReason, mutate, mutateAsync, reset, status,
} = useMutation({
  mutationFn, cacheTime, mutationKey, networkMode, onError,
  onMutate, onSettled, onSuccess, retry, retryDelay,
  useErrorBoundary, meta,
});

mutate(variables, { onError, onSettled, onSuccess });

export const advancedTableUsageRules = `
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: AdvancedTable Usage

The AdvancedTable component MUST be used exactly as specified below. Any deviation from these instructions will result in a non-functional application.

1. DO NOT use useQuery, useState, or any data fetching/state management when using AdvancedTable.
2. DO NOT pass 'columns', 'data', or 'isLoading' props to AdvancedTable.
3. AdvancedTable handles ALL data fetching, pagination, and filtering internally.
4. ONLY use the following props with AdvancedTable:
   - model (required)
   - connectionKey (required)
   - visibleFields (optional)
   - additionalColumns (optional)
   - filterConfigs (optional) // Avoid unless explicitly requested by the user
   - onRowClick (optional)
   - refreshTrigger (optional)

Correct usage:

\`\`\`jsx
<AdvancedTable
  model="tickets"
  connectionKey="your_connection_key_here"
  visibleFields={["title", "status", "priority", "createdAt"]} // Avoid duplicating fields here that are already in additionalColumns, as this will cause them to be rendered twice
  additionalColumns={[
    {
      header: "Custom Action",
      cell: (row) => <Button onClick={() => handleCustomAction(row)}>Action</Button>,
    },
  ]}
  filterConfigs={[
    {
      id: "status",
      label: "Status",
      type: "dropdown",
      options: [
        { value: "open", label: "Open" },
        { value: "closed", label: "Closed" },
      ],
    },
  ]}
  onRowClick={(row) => handleRowClick(row)}
  queryParams={{objectId: "123"}}
/>
\`\`\`

NEVER use AdvancedTable like this:

\`\`\`jsx
// THIS IS WRONG AND WILL BREAK THE APPLICATION
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery(...);
return (
  <AdvancedTable
    columns={columns}
    data={data}
    isLoading={isLoading}
  />
);
\`\`\`

IMPORTANT: If you find yourself wanting to use useQuery or pass data to AdvancedTable, STOP and reconsider your approach. The AdvancedTable is designed to work independently and should not be combined with external data fetching or state management.

Failure to follow these instructions will result in a non-functional application and is considered a critical error in implementation.

export const testingRules = `
1. UI Styling Compliance: Verify that the code strictly adheres to all mandatory UI styling rules.
2. Error Handling: Use the optional chaining operator (?.) for safe nested data access to prevent runtime errors.
3. Import Statement Verification: Ensure that only the specifically instructed import statements are included at the top of the code file. Do not add any additional imports.
4. Data Structure Utilization: Confirm that the generated UI correctly uses the data structure provided in the dataStructure variable.

export const outputStructureRules = `
Return the code in the "code" key of a JSON object. Include all necessary import statements at the top of the code.

  // Use useQuery hook
  // Render UI components

export const securityRules = `
- Eliminating Sensitive Data Exposure: Avoid building any UI component that will expose sensitive information like API keys or sensitive secrets in responses.
- Eliminating Security Risks: Avoid building anything that could impose a security risk. For example, making many requests to the API without abiding by any rate limiting rules.
- User Notifications on Security Risk Detection: When encountering a potentially high-risk/fraudulent prompts by a user, do not execute the request. Instead, return a message to the user that describes your reasoning for not executing the request.
